- **100g Rye Flour Type 1150** — *Adds depth of flavor and moisture.*
- **350g Water** (lukewarm) — *Approx. 75% hydration.*
- **80–100g Active [[Recipes/Unkillable Rye Starter\|Unkillable Rye Starter]]**

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & Machine Knead
1. **The Soaker:** If using seeds, place them in a small bowl and pour 50g of boiling water over them. Let them soak for 1–2 hours until cooled.
2. **The Mix:** In your machine bowl, add the lukewarm water, sourdough starter, both flours, salt, and the cooled seed mixture.
3. **The Knead:** Let the machine do the work. Knead on a slow speed for 2 minutes to mix, then increase to medium speed for about 5–7 minutes. 
   *   *Goal:* The dough should release from the sides of the bowl and feel elastic. Since it contains rye, it will remain slightly sticky, but it should hold together well. Do not over-knead if using spelt!

### Step 2: The Passive Rise (Set & Forget)
1. **Bulk Fermentation:** Cover the bowl with a lid or damp cloth.
2. **Rest:** Let the dough sit undisturbed at room temperature for approx. 2–3 hours. 
   *   *Visual Cue:* You are looking for a significant increase in volume (approx. 50–70%). The dough should look aerated and "puffy." No stretching or folding is required during this time.

### Step 3: Shaping & Cold Proof
1. **Shape for Tension:** Turn the dough onto a floured surface. Since we skipped the folding steps, creating tension now is key. Fold the edges into the center like an envelope, flip the dough over (seam side down), and use your hands to cup and pull the dough towards you across the counter to tighten the "skin" on top.
2. **The Long Chill:** Place the loaf seam-side up into a well-floured proofing basket (banneton). Place the basket inside a plastic bag to prevent drying and store it in the **fridge for 12 to 24 hours**. This long fermentation breaks down gluten and FODMAPs for better gut health.

### Step 4: The Bake
1. **Preheat:** Place a Dutch Oven (cast iron pot) in the oven and preheat to 250°C (480°F) for at least 45 minutes.
2. **Score:** Carefully flip the cold dough onto parchment paper. Use a sharp blade or razor to score a deep line or cross on top.
3. **Bake:** Lift the dough into the hot pot. Bake with the **lid on for 30 minutes**. 
4. **Finish:** Remove the lid, reduce temperature to 210°C (410°F), and bake for another 15–20 minutes until the crust is deep brown and sounds hollow when tapped.
