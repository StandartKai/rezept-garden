## Instructions
### Step 1: Prep
1. **Sauce:** Mix the Dijon mustard, mayo, onion powder, garlic powder, and a splash of the liquid from the pickled onions.
2. **Patties:** Shape the beef into balls. Work quickly so the warmth of your hands doesn't melt the fat.

### Step 2: Smash & Cook
1. Place the beef balls into a hot pan. 
2. Place a piece of parchment paper between the patty and the spatula, then smash the patty down flat.
3. Season with salt and pepper. Flip only once.
4. Top with cheddar cheese and let it melt.
