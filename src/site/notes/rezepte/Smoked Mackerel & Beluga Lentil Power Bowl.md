## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep & "The Pickle"
1.  **Macerate the Onion:** Finely dice the red onion and place it in a large serving bowl. Pour over the juice of the lemon, the vinegar, and a generous pinch of salt. Massage briefly and let sit for at least 10 minutes. *Science: This removes the harsh raw bite and turns the onion into a crunchy pickle.*
2.  **Toast & Flake:** In a dry stainless steel skillet, toast the walnuts over medium heat for 2–3 minutes until fragrant, then roughly chop. Peel the skin off the mackerel and flake the meat into large chunks. Cube the cucumber and chop the parsley (including stems).

### Step 2: The Cook & Assembly
1.  **Pressure Cook Lentils:** Rinse lentils. Add to the pressure cooker with water/stock and the bay leaf. Cook on **High Pressure for 6 minutes**, then Quick Release. (If they are slightly firm, that is perfect for salad).
2.  **The Temper:** Drain the lentils well. Immediately dump the **hot** lentils into the bowl with the pickled onions and toss. *Science: The hot starch absorbs the acidity and onion flavor better than cold lentils.*
3.  **Finish:** Add the olive oil, cucumber, walnuts, and parsley. Mix well. Finally, gently fold in the mackerel chunks and crumbled feta (do this last so they don't disintegrate). Taste for salt/pepper.
