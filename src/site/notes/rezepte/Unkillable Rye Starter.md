# Unkillable Rye Starter

*Philosophy: Treat your starter like a cactus, not a puppy. Rye is robust and forgiving. This routine is designed for baking once a week.*

## The Setup
- **The Flour:** 100% Whole Grain Rye Flour
- **The Vessel:** A clean glass jar
- **The Location:** The Fridge (standard 4°C–7°C).

## 1. The "Wake Up" (Pre-Bake Prep)
*Goal: To ensure you have 80–100g of strong, active starter for your dough, plus a little leftover to keep the cycle going.*

**When:** The night before or the morning of the day you plan to mix your dough (Step 1 of the bread recipe).

1.  **Take it out:** Remove your jar from the fridge.
2.  **The Feed:** Add **50g Water** and **50g Whole Rye Flour** to the jar.
3.  **Mix:** Stir vigorously with a spoon until no dry flour remains. It should look like thick mud or cement paste.
4.  **The Wait:** Leave it on the kitchen counter at room temperature.
5.  **The Check:** It is ready to use when it has grown significantly (doubled in size) and looks "moussy" and aerated on the inside. This usually takes **4–8 hours** depending on room temperature.

## 2. The Bake & The Refill (The Cycle)
*Goal: Use the peak power for the bread, save the rest for next time.*

1.  **Extract:** Scoop out the **80–100g** needed for your *No-Stress Longevity Loaf* recipe.
2.  **The Remainder:** You should have a small amount of "dirty scrapings" (approx. 20–50g) left in the jar. **Do not wash the jar.**
3.  **The "Feed for Sleep":** Add **50g Water** and **50g Whole Rye Flour** to the scrapings. Mix well.
4.  **The Head Start:** Let this sit on the counter for about **2–3 hours**. You want the fermentation to *start* (you see a few bubbles), but you don't want it to peak yet.
5.  **Hibernation:** Put the lid on and place it back in the fridge. It will sit there happily for up to 7–10 days until you are ready to bake again.

## 3. Emergency Maintenance (No Bake Week)
*If you skip baking for a week or two, the starter will get hungry and acidic.*

1.  **Discard:** Take the jar out. Spoon out and discard (or compost) about 80% of the contents.
2.  **Feed:** Add 50g Water + 50g Rye Flour.
3.  **Wait & Chill:** Let sit for 2–3 hours, then return to fridge.
