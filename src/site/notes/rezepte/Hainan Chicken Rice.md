![chicken_rice.jpeg|500](/img/user/images/chicken_rice.jpeg)
## Ingredients
*   **Chicken:** 2 large chicken breasts
*   **Rice Base:** 1 LOBO Chicken Rice Kit (includes rice paste, dipping sauce, and soup/broth seasoning)
*   **Aromatics:** 1 knob of ginger (approx. 2 inches) and 1 bunch of scallions (spring onions)
*   **Finish:** Sesame oil
*   **For the Oil:** Neutral oil (e.g., canola or vegetable), salt

## 1. Ginger Scallion Oil
1.  Finely mince a portion of the **ginger** and the **green parts of the scallions**.
2.  Place the mixture in a heat-proof bowl and mix in a pinch of **salt**.
3.  Heat 2–3 tablespoons of **neutral oil** in a small pan until it is shimmering/almost smoking.
4.  Carefully pour the hot oil over the ginger and scallions. It should sizzle. Stir and set aside.

## 2. The Chicken (Steeping Method)
1.  **Prepare the Pot:** Choose a pot that fits the chicken breasts snugly. Fill it with enough water to cover the chicken later. Add a generous amount of **salt**, several slices of **ginger**, and the **green tops** of the remaining scallions.
2.  **Boil:** Bring the water to a rolling boil.
3.  **Flash Cook:** Submerge the chicken breasts in the boiling water. Let them boil rapidly for **exactly 1 minute**.
4.  **Steep:** Turn off the heat immediately! Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If using an electric or induction stove, simply leave the pot on the burner (the residual heat is enough). **Do not open the lid.**
5.  **Rest:** Let the chicken steep in the hot water for **20 minutes**. This ensures the meat remains incredibly juicy.
6.  **The Stock:** Remove the chicken. **Do not discard the poaching liquid!** Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl or pot to remove the spent ginger and scallions. You now have a fragrant, fortified chicken stock.
7.  **The Shine:** Immediately rub the warm chicken breasts all over with a little **sesame oil**. This adds a beautiful glaze, replaces the fat usually found in the skin, and prevents the meat from drying out.

## 3. The Broth and Rice

### The Broth (Soup)
1.  Measure out **400ml of the hot poaching liquid** and place it in a small saucepan.
2.  Add the **LOBO broth powder** to this liquid. 
3.  Bring to a simmer, stir well, and keep warm. This ensures your soup is double-infused with chicken flavor.

### The Rice
1.  Place your washed rice and the **LOBO rice paste** into the rice cooker.
2.  Pour any **remaining poaching liquid** into the rice cooker. 
3.  If the liquid doesn't reach the required fill line for your rice, supplement the rest with plain water until you reach the correct level. 
4.  Cook as usual. This replaces as much water as possible with the flavorful stock.

## 4. Serving
- Slice the chicken breasts into strips.
- Serve alongside the seasoned rice.
- Side Soup: Serve the 400ml of broth in side bowls (2 x 200ml).
- **Dipping Sauces:**
    - The sauce included in the LOBO kit.
    - Homemade Ginger Scallion Oil.
    - Optional: Sweet soy sauce (e.g., Kecap Manis).
