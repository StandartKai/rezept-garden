## 1. Ginger Scallion Oil
1.  Finely mince a portion of the **ginger** and the **green parts of the scallions**.
2.  Place the mixture in a heat-proof bowl and mix in a pinch of **salt**.
3.  Heat 2–3 tablespoons of **neutral oil** in a small pan until it is shimmering/almost smoking.
4.  Carefully pour the hot oil over the ginger and scallions. It should sizzle. Stir and set aside.

## 2. The Chicken (Steeping Method)
1.  **Prepare the Pot:** Choose a pot that fits the chicken breasts snugly. Fill it with enough water to cover the chicken later. Add a generous amount of **salt**, several slices of **ginger**, and the **green tops** of the remaining scallions.
2.  **Boil:** Bring the water to a rolling boil.
3.  **Flash Cook:** Submerge the chicken breasts in the boiling water. Let them boil rapidly for **exactly 1 minute**.
4.  **Steep:** Turn off the heat immediately! Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If using an electric or induction stove, simply leave the pot on the burner (the residual heat is enough). **Do not open the lid.**
5.  **Rest:** Let the chicken steep in the hot water for **20 minutes**. This ensures the meat remains incredibly juicy.
6.  **The Stock:** Remove the chicken. **Important:** Do not discard the poaching liquid! You will use this flavorful stock instead of plain water to cook your rice.
7.  **The Shine:** Immediately rub the warm chicken breasts all over with a little **sesame oil**. This adds a beautiful glaze, replaces the fat usually found in the skin, and prevents the meat from drying out.

## 3. The Rice
1.  Prepare your rice according to the LOBO kit instructions.
2.  **Pro Tip:** Instead of using plain water, use the **reserved poaching liquid** from the chicken to cook the rice for maximum flavor.

## 4. Serving
- Slice the chicken breasts into strips.
- Serve alongside the seasoned rice.
- **Dipping Sauces:**
    - The sauce included in the LOBO kit.
    - Homemade **Ginger Scallion Oil**.
    - Optional: Sweet soy sauce (e.g., Kecap Manis).
